should i use pyqgis or geoalchemy2 to combine geometries which are part of a declarative model instance

For combining geometries that are part of a declarative model instance, GeoAlchemy2 is the more appropriate choice over PyQGIS

. GeoAlchemy2 is specifically designed to work with spatial databases and SQLAlchemy ORM, making it a better fit for your use case.

Here's how you can combine geometries using GeoAlchemy2:

    Define your model with a geometry column:

python
from geoalchemy2 import Geometry
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class YourModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'your_table'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    geometry = Column(Geometry('POLYGON'))

    Use SQLAlchemy's func object to call spatial functions:

python
from sqlalchemy import func
from geoalchemy2.shape import to_shape
from shapely.wkt import dumps

# Assuming you have two instances of YourModel
instance1 = session.query(YourModel).get(1)
instance2 = session.query(YourModel).get(2)

# Combine geometries using ST_Union
combined_geom = session.scalar(
    func.ST_Union(instance1.geometry, instance2.geometry)
)

# Convert to WKT if needed
wkt_geom = session.scalar(func.ST_AsText(combined_geom))

This approach allows you to work directly with your declarative model instances and leverage the power of PostGIS functions through GeoAlchemy2

. It's more integrated with your database operations and doesn't require switching between different libraries like PyQGIS would.
how to combine geometries from relationship in sqlalchemy in a hybrid property
how to combine geometries from relationship in sqlalchemy in a hybrid property

To combine geometries from a relationship in SQLAlchemy using a hybrid property, you can leverage GeoAlchemy2's spatial functions along with SQLAlchemy's hybrid_property decorator. Here's how you can achieve this:

    First, ensure you have the necessary imports:

python
from sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid import hybrid_property
from sqlalchemy import func
from geoalchemy2 import Geometry

    Define your models with the appropriate relationships:

python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    children = relationship("Child", back_populates="parent")

    @hybrid_property
    def combined_geometry(self):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom).label('combined_geom')

    @combined_geometry.expression
    def combined_geometry(cls):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom).label('combined_geom')

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'child'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id'))
    parent = relationship("Parent", back_populates="children")
    geom = Column(Geometry('POLYGON'))

    Use the hybrid property in your queries:

python
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

query = session.query(Parent).options(joinedload(Parent.children))
result = query.filter(Parent.combined_geometry.ST_Intersects('POINT(0 0)')).all()

This approach allows you to combine the geometries of related Child objects for each Parent object using the ST_Union function
. The hybrid_property decorator enables you to use this property both at the Python level and in SQL queries

.

Remember that the performance of this method depends on the number of related geometries and the complexity of the spatial operations. For large datasets, you might want to consider creating a materialized view or using database-specific optimizations

How can I use a hybrid property to combine geometries from a relationship in SQLAlchemy
How can I use a hybrid property to combine geometries from a relationship in SQLAlchemy

To combine geometries from a relationship using a hybrid property in SQLAlchemy, you can leverage GeoAlchemy2's spatial functions along with SQLAlchemy's hybrid_property decorator. Here's how to implement this:

    First, import the necessary modules:

python
from sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid import hybrid_property
from sqlalchemy import func
from geoalchemy2 import Geometry

    Define your models with the appropriate relationships:

python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    children = relationship("Child", back_populates="parent")

    @hybrid_property
    def combined_geometry(self):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom)

    @combined_geometry.expression
    def combined_geometry(cls):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom)

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'child'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id'))
    parent = relationship("Parent", back_populates="children")
    geom = Column(Geometry('POLYGON'))

    Use the hybrid property in your queries:

python
query = session.query(Parent).options(joinedload(Parent.children))
result = query.filter(Parent.combined_geometry.ST_Intersects('POINT(0 0)')).all()

This approach allows you to combine the geometries of related Child objects for each Parent object using the ST_Union function
. The hybrid_property decorator enables you to use this property both at the Python level and in SQL queries

.

Keep in mind that the performance of this method depends on the number of related geometries and the complexity of the spatial operations. For large datasets, you might want to consider creating a materialized view or using database-specific optimizations.

Additionally, when using relationships in hybrid properties, be aware that they may only work when querying the entire object, not when querying the attribute alone
. If you encounter issues, you may need to adjust your query strategy or consider using a different approach, such as the association_proxy extension

.
what is '@combined_geometry.expression' for?
what is '@combined_geometry.expression' for?

The '@combined_geometry.expression' decorator is used to define the SQL expression version of a hybrid property in SQLAlchemy. It allows you to specify how the property should be translated into a SQL expression when used in database queries

.

When you define a hybrid property, you typically provide two implementations:

    The Python-level implementation, which is used when accessing the property on an instance of the class.

    The SQL expression-level implementation, which is used when the property is referenced in database queries.

The '@combined_geometry.expression' decorator is used to define this second implementation. It enables you to create complex SQL expressions that can be used in filters, order_by clauses, and other query operations

.

For example, in the context of combining geometries from a relationship:

python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    children = relationship("Child", back_populates="parent")

    @hybrid_property
    def combined_geometry(self):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom)

    @combined_geometry.expression
    def combined_geometry(cls):
        return func.ST_Union(Child.geom)

Here, the '@combined_geometry.expression' decorator allows the 'combined_geometry' property to be used in SQL queries, translating the Python function into a database-specific SQL expression for combining geometries

.

This dual implementation ensures that the hybrid property behaves correctly both when accessed on a Python object and when used in database queries, providing a seamless integration between your Python code and SQL operations
